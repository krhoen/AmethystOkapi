Final Project
An Interactive Fiction by Kristen Ho (kho11) and Martina Stepisnik (mstepisn)
Release 1 / Serial number 150605 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Tower
A spacious room with tall, open windows. You can see the purple of the sun and the three pink moons from here, against a backdrop of green sky. The middle of the room is open, allowing you to see the bookshelves below. The stairs on the south side of the tower lead down into the Library.

Throne Room
A huge, open space, complete with pillars, paintings, and a beautiful view of the outside world that you will never get to explore.

A flag hangs above the royal Standard Lecture Hall Seat. Three horizontal bands of red, white, and blue superimposed by the Croatian coat of arms.

In the center, near the back of the room you see the throne of Cramalot&apos;s ruler: the Standard Lecture Hall Seat, barely comfortable fabric, plastic backing, one of those little table things you can pull up from the side. It&apos;s not exactly glorious, and so old you can see the springs pressing up from within the seat. Even so, it beckons to you.

A great warrior, chosen by the rulers of the rhelm, followed him through the rhelms and eventually put and end to his quest.  To ensure this never happened again, the rhelms were disconennected from each other and one could only travel between them under very specific circumstances.&quot;

You try your luck: &quot;You visit a remote desert island inhabited by one hundred very friendly dragons, all of whom have green eyes. They haven&apos;t seen a human for many centuries and are very excited about your visit. They show you around their island and tell you all about their dragon way of life (dragons can talk, of course). They seem to be quite normal, as far as dragons go, but then you find out something rather odd. They have a rule on the island which states that if a dragon ever finds out that they have green eyes, then at precisely midnight on the day of this discovery, they must relinquish all dragon powers and transform into a longtailed sparrow. However, there are no mirrors on the island, and they never talk about eye color, so the dragons have been living in blissful ignorance throughout the ages. Upon your departure, all the dragons get together to see you off, and in a tearful farewell you thank them for being such hospitable dragons. Then you decide to tell them something that they all already know (for each can see the colors of the eyes of the other dragons). You tell them all that at least one of them has green eyes. Then you leave, not thinking of the consequences (if any). Assuming that the dragons are (of course) infallibly logical, what happens? If something interesting does happen, what exactly is the new information that you gave the dragons?&quot; Nope. Nuh-uh. Never again.

Throne Room
A huge, open space, complete with pillars, paintings, and a beautiful view of the outside world that you will never get to explore.

A flag hangs above the royal Standard Lecture Hall Seat. Three horizontal bands of red, white, and blue superimposed by the Croatian coat of arms.

In the center, near the back of the room you see the throne of Cramalot&apos;s ruler: the Standard Lecture Hall Seat, barely comfortable fabric, plastic backing, one of those little table things you can pull up from the side. It&apos;s not exactly glorious, and so old you can see the springs pressing up from within the seat. Even so, it beckons to you.

They haven&apos;t seen a human for many centuries and are very excited about your visit. They show you around their island and tell you all about their dragon way of life (dragons can talk, of course). They seem to be quite normal, as far as dragons go, but then you find out something rather odd. They have a rule on the island which states that if a dragon ever finds out that they have green eyes, then at precisely midnight on the day of this discovery, they must relinquish all dragon powers and transform into a longtailed sparrow. However, there are no mirrors on the island, and they never talk about eye color, so the dragons have been living in blissful ignorance throughout the ages. Upon your departure, all the dragons get together to see you off, and in a tearful farewell you thank them for being such hospitable dragons. Then you decide to tell them something that they all already know (for each can see the colors of the eyes of the other dragons). You tell them all that at least one of them has green eyes. Then you leave, not thinking of the consequences (if any). Assuming that the dragons are (of course) infallibly logical, what happens? If something interesting does happen, what exactly is the new information that you gave the dragons?&quot; Nope. Nuh-uh. Never again.

Throne Room
A huge, open space, complete with pillars, paintings, and a beautiful view of the outside world that you will never get to explore.

A flag hangs above the royal Standard Lecture Hall Seat. Three horizontal bands of red, white, and blue superimposed by the Croatian coat of arms.

In the center, near the back of the room you see the throne of Cramalot&apos;s ruler: the Standard Lecture Hall Seat, barely comfortable fabric, plastic backing, one of those little table things you can pull up from the side. It&apos;s not exactly glorious, and so old you can see the springs pressing up from within the seat. Even so, it beckons to you.
