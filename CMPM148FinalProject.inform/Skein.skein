Tower
A spacious room with tall, open windows. You can see the purple of the sun and the three pink moons from here, against a backdrop of green sky. The middle of the room is open, allowing you to see the bookshelves below. The stairs on the south side of the tower lead down into the Library.

Throne Room
A huge, open space, complete with pillars, paintings, and a beautiful view of the outside world that you will never get to explore.

A flag hangs above the royal Standard Lecture Hall Seat. Three horizontal bands of red, white, and blue superimposed by the Croatian coat of arms.

In the center, near the back of the room you see the throne of Cramalot&apos;s ruler: the Standard Lecture Hall Seat, barely comfortable fabric, plastic backing, one of those little table things you can pull up from the side. It&apos;s not exactly glorious, and so old you can see the springs pressing up from within the seat. Even so, it beckons to you.

Lounge
A minimally-furnished lounge area that contains a tan carpet on top of which are two white sofas separated by a coffee table.  There is also a seaweed plant in a pot in the corner of the room.  Weird choice of decor, but whatever.  The back wall is made entirely of glass, and you can see various sea creatures swimming about and a beautiful view of the outside world that you will never get to explore.   &quot;Where the hell am I now?&quot; you think to yourself...

Throne Room
A huge, open space, complete with pillars, paintings, and a beautiful view of the outside world that you will never get to explore.

A flag hangs above the royal Standard Lecture Hall Seat. Three horizontal bands of red, white, and blue superimposed by the Croatian coat of arms.

In the center, near the back of the room you see the throne of Cramalot&apos;s ruler: the Standard Lecture Hall Seat, barely comfortable fabric, plastic backing, one of those little table things you can pull up from the side. It&apos;s not exactly glorious, and so old you can see the springs pressing up from within the seat. Even so, it beckons to you.
